Employing Realtor.com Housing Listing data and web-scraped median income data to determine relative housing cost by region

In conjunction with the data and analysis from "Plot 1," I hope to also incorporate the relative cost of living changes across time and region.
To get at that, I downloaded information 74,000 housing listings from Realtor.com across the entire United States from 2012-2018. Additionally, I 
web-scraped the median income by state. Taken together, I can calculate the ratio of median-income to median-house-price by region, and track changes
over time. 

Similar to "Plot 1," the data is helpful for prediction in its richest form (by county and by month) but does not visualize well. For this exercise
I map just one year of data (2015) onto a geographical map of the United States to visualize the relative cost of housing in each state. A simple app
would allow one to slide between years and see changes on a national level, or one could plot line-graphs to view the trajectory of relative cost of living
for selected regions. 

My visualization shows a wide range of values across the United States. While Texas faired well in "Plot 1," it is out-shined by numerous other states
from a relative cost of living perspective. By combining the data and insights from "Plot 1" and "Plot 2," individuals and businesses that are looking to 
relocate could be greatly empowered in their decision making.
